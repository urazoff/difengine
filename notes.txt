Axioms:
1. Keep it simple. Make it more complex only if it will be more efficient.

Internal design:
1. Explicitly define what kind of object is field or function argument
   if it is not any object.

TODO:
1. List objects: extend items vector. Define extension itself in /memory.
2. Code: how to consider opcode if opcode is list object.
   May be do internal array of uints?
3. Objects: make it possible to cast float and list to DfObject and vice versa.
4. Generalize/put to function common operations (i.e. init, cast, 
   get list element and cast it to some specific object etc).
5. Get rid of memory leak (always).
6. Error handling.
7. Make code consistent codestyle-wise.
8. Write and build doc.
